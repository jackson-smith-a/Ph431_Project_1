The file [relaxation3d.py](relaxation3d.py) implements the algorithm discussed in the lecture to calculate the potential for simple boxes in 3D space. Your task is to extend this program to support spheres with constant charge or constant potential by writing a function `make_sphere(...)` that mirros `make_box3d()`, and to compute and plot the charge density and electric field everywhere in space for a box at a constant, nonzero potential inside a sphere of constant surface charge.

The solution can be found in [solution.py](solution.py).
